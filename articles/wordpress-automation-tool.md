# Automating WordPress Site Creation in Laravel Herd Environments

*A Python tool that streamlines WordPress development workflows*

## The Problem: WordPress Setup Takes Too Much Time

As WordPress developers, we've all been there - spending precious time on repetitive setup tasks instead of actual development. Creating a new WordPress site involves multiple steps:

1. Downloading WordPress
2. Setting up databases
3. Configuring wp-config.php 
4. Running the installer
5. Setting up local domains

When working with multiple client sites, these steps consume hours of development time, especially when dealing with Windows-specific issues like the dreaded "sh not found" error.

## The Solution: WordPress Site Creator

I've developed a Python script that automates the entire WordPress setup process specifically for Laravel Herd environments. With a single command, you can:

```bash
python create_wordpress.py client-site
```

This command automatically:

- Downloads and extracts the latest WordPress version
- Creates and configures a MySQL database
- Generates secure WordPress salts
- Registers the site with Laravel Herd
- Secures the site with SSL certificate
- Completes WordPress installation via WP-CLI

## Key Features

- **Windows Compatibility**: Handles common Windows-specific WP-CLI errors
- **Multiple Fallback Methods**: If one installation approach fails, it tries alternatives
- **Customizable Configuration**: Override defaults via command-line arguments
- **Detailed Error Handling**: Clear error messages and troubleshooting suggestions

## How It Works

The script orchestrates several processes:

1. **WordPress Download**: Fetches the latest version directly from wordpress.org
2. **Database Setup**: Connects to MySQL and creates a new database
3. **Configuration**: Generates a properly configured wp-config.php file
4. **Laravel Herd Integration**: Registers the site and secures it with SSL
5. **WordPress Installation**: Uses WP-CLI to complete the installation process

### Example Advanced Usage

```bash
python create_wordpress.py client-site --title="Client Website" --admin-user="clientadmin" --admin-pass="secure_password" --admin-email="client@example.com"
```

## Open Source and Available Now
